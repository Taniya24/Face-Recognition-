# Face-Recognition-
This document will guide you how to use the face recognition code and use it 

The first code named Python- face detection will help you in recognising the faces that are
there in the picture. And if some faces are not recognised you can select them using your mouse.

The second code named Python - face recognition will help you recognise the face in the dataset and 
it is faster than the traditional methods. 

The third code named Python - real time face detection will help you in recognising the face in real time. 

Report for the project has been attached in the link.
